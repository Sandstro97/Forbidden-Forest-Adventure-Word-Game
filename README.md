I created this Forbidden Forest Adventure Game because I wanted to created a fun word game that and with my love of Harry Potter I figured mixing the two would be a great way to practice my coding skills. 

My Process:

1. The first thing I did was make a rough list of ideas of what creatures that could be found in the forbidden forest. After some research. I conducted my list

2. Once I had my list figured out I went to Figma and used FigJam to create a layout of how I wanted the movements to go and where the items on my list were going to be placed. 

3. I then started on coding the game. The first thing I did was create an outline of all the components I would need and then added in the filler that is included to each section. Once everything was set. I started to fill in the information.

4. Then I ran a few tests to make sure my project was complete.
